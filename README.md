# tabaco-vue-material

I try and continue to build a Material UI Plugin fro Vue + Typescript.
So far, the plugins which have been finish are as follows:
- Editor Fields:
  - Combobox(Component) - For single option
  - MultiCombobox(Component) - For multiple options
  - Numberfield(Component) - For number
  - Switcher(Component) - For boolean
  - Textfield(Component) - For single line string
  - Textarea(Component) - For multiple lines string
- Form:
  - Form Group(Component) - This is a cell for editors, and it's basic on Bootstrap's Grid layout
- Tools
  - Snackbar(Directive & Component) - Alert
  - Dialog(Directive & Component) - Prompt / Confirm
  - Theme(Directive) - Set the skin of panel or body
  - Mobile Stress Field(Component) - For input of mobile
